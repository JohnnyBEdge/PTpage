          <h2>Alter-G Anti-Gravity Treadmill</h2>

          <img id="runner"src="/home/john/documents/projects/PT/photos/alterGrunner.jpg" alt="Runner in Alter-G">

          <p>Unlike any other piece of training equipment
             available, the AlterG Anti-Gravity Treadmill
              can take you further, faster than you ever
              thought possible after surgery, injury or other
              mobility impairment. It is safer, more effective, and
              more convenient that pool therapy.</p>
              <br>

          <p>The Alter-G Treadmill can be used for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical therapy following an injury or surgery on a
               lower extremity (hip, knee, ankle or foot)</li><br>
            <li>Rehab after total joint replacement</li><br>
            <li>Gait training and strengthening</li><br>
            <li>Injury prevention during sport specific conditioning
               and fitness improvement programs</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Athletic Training</h2>
          <p>This state-of-the-art technology is ideal for all
            types of athletes including top-level pros, weekend
            warriors, and university/high school athletes. The
            Anti-Gravity Treadmill is the key to elevating your
            training and sports injury rehab, and as a result,
            achieving your personal best.</p>
      <br>

          <p>It is also the perfect tool for aging athletes who
            desire to prolong their career. The Anti-Gravity
            Treadmill enables the older athlete to maintain and
             even increase endurance and leg strength, without the
             usual pounding such training entails.</p>
<br>
          <p>Using advanced unweighting technology to provide
            unsurpassed support, safety and stability, this
            treadmill is also ideal for geriatric patients
            recovering from neurologic and orthopedic-related
            injuries.</p>

          <h2>The Alter-G Difference</h2>
          <p>With its unique unweighting capabilities, the
            Anti-Gravity Treadmill allows you and your physical
             therapist to move your rehabilitation and training
             forward by:</p>

             <ul class="altergdif">
               <li>Allowing you to walk or run with no pain while
                 maintaining a normal gait</li><br>
               <li>Reducing stress on joints and injured areas of
                 your lower body</li><br>
              <li>Giving you the confidence and ability to run or
                walk longer and recover faster with less pain</li>
             </ul>
