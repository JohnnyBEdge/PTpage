          <h2>General Questions</h2>
          <h4>What is a physical therapist?</h4>
              <p>Physical therapists are health care professionals who diagnose and
              treat medical problems and health-related conditions
              limiting your ability to move and function in your daily life.
               Simply put, physical therapy brings motion to life!</p>

          <h4>Is it going to hurt?</h4>
              <p>This is a common question. In nearly all cases the
                answer at PRC is no. Physical therapy doesn't hurt.
                Historically, people experienced excruciating pain during
                rehab after procedures like ACL surgery. Since then, however,
                we have greatly improved protocols for pain management, rehab
                programs, and treatment techniques. While it is true that some
                parts of treatment can be uncomfortable for a short time, the
                immediate improvement in function is worth it to most patients.
                 In our clinic, you decide how far we go. We are here to help
                  you reach YOUR goals.</p>

          <h4>Why Ice?</h4>
              <p>Ice has been a common treatment in PT clinics for decades.
                 While it provides temporary numbing, ice also affects the
                 circulatory system as deep as one centimeter below the
                 surface before any tissue damage takes place (in contrast
                 to heat, which penetrates less than Â¼ centimeter prior to
                 tissue damage). The combination of ice and electrical
                 stimulation are used to improve comfort after therapy and
                 theoretically speed recovery.</p>

          <h4>How long will my visit take?</h4>
              <p>All visits generally take about one hour.</p>

          <h4>What should I wear?</h4>
              <p>Depending on the injury and type of therapy we will work on,
                we usually recommend loose-fitting clothes you can move around
                 in. We do have a dressing room available for patients who
                 need to bring clothes to change into. For knee injuries, we
                 prefer you bring or wear shorts. For should injuries, a
                 loose-fitting t-shirt works well. The main guideline is wearing
                  something you are comfortable in!</p>

          <h4>Will my insurance pay for PT?</h4>
              <p>Nearly every health plan has a physical therapy benefit.
                In some cases, the dollar amount or the number of visits per
                year may be limited. Our pre-authorization department can
                help you determine what your insurance will allow. Feel free
                to contact us prior to your visit if you are anxious to know
                what benefits you qualify for.</p>

            <p>“I have been to other facilities. I like it better here at
              PRC because there is a more personal, homey feel to it.”</p>
              <br>
              <br>
            <p>“Your therapists took the time to listen to me…that doesn’t
               happen very often in healthcare anymore. Thanks for treating
               me like more than a number.”</p>
               <br>
               <br>
            <p>“You guys are the best! I’ve never worked like that, stretched
              so much, and laughed so hard in a long time. And by the way,
               yes, I’m still doing my exercises.”</p>
               <br>
               <br>
            <p>“I don’t like doctors and I don’t like exercise. I thought
              therapy would be painful too. Instead they took the time to
              teach me about my body and what I could do to fix it. I’m a
              do-it-yourselfer and that’s what I got from PT. With
              [my therapist’s] help I even learned how I could keep this from
               happening again.”</p>
               <br>
               <br>
            <p>“My doctor recommended therapy to help my pain. I have to admit
              I was skeptical. It took me a while to buy into the whole
              exercise thing, but now I’m able to do more than I have in a
              long time. Besides that, I’m taking less pain medication, which
               I’m happy about.”</p>
               <br>
               <br>
            <p>“My surgeon was great but I don’t think I realized completely
              what it was going to take to get back to normal life. The
              therapists were great to support me and teach me what was going
               on in my knee. I’m glad they didn’t give up on me even when I
               was ready to give up on me.”</p>
               <br>
               <br>
            <p>“I’ve always been into exercise, so getting hurt really set me
               back. I learned the hard way that I’m not 25 anymore.
               [The PRC therapist] adjusted my rehab to me…I mean personalized
               it to what I like to do. My back feels better and I know what
                my limitations are. I’m a lot more aware after going to PT.”</p>
                <br>
                <br>
            <p>“Your therapists just get it. I’ve been to a lot of ‘em and these
               guys are the best I’ve seen. My feedback is keep doin’ what
               you’re doin’.”</p>
