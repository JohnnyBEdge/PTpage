          <p>Physical therapy has quickly become one of the
            most costly elements of work-related musculoskeletal
            injuries. In Utah, physical therapy now exceeds doctors
            office visits in total workers compensation costs. To
            alleviate this, coming to a clinic that cares about your
             costs is important. At Performance Rehab Clinic, we learn
              about your company and find ways to get your employees
              back to work faster. We minimize your costs by
              eliminating excessive visits, focusing on return to work,
               and encouraging light duty (instead of off-duty). With
               extensive experience on over 1200 job sites along the
               Wasatch Front and Western United States, we have the
                knowledge and experience to ensure the best care
                 possible.</p>


      <h2>Onsite Services</h2>
          <p>How many times has a physical therapist come to your business
             to recommend ways to help reduce on-the-job accidents
             and injuries? PRC has developed an onsite-consulting
             program based on experience with worker’s comp injuries
             in your industry. Performance Rehab Clinics is focused on
              customer service for out clients, which includes
              reducing injuries in the workplace.</p>

          <h2>Ergonomics</h2>
          <p> At Performance Rehab we see ergonomic consulting as
             a value-added service for our large clients. As your
             exclusive therapy provider, we are able to address
             problem areas specifically, based on how injuries have
             occurred or may occur in the future to the musculoskeletal
              systems of employees. In consultation with your
              facilities department we offer low- to no-cost solutions
              to help workers better fit the job. The effectiveness of
              an ergonomic solution is best measured by decreased
              injury exposure; as experts in injury exposure we are
              uniquely positioned to give you relevant advice.</p>

          <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>Even one workers’ comp claim a year can adversely
              affect your bottom line. Prevention of on-the-job
              injuries is key to any company. Research has shown
              companies that develop a strong “safety culture” have
              significantly lower workers’ comp claims. PRC takes the
              time to understand your needs and helps your employees
              develop an overall safety mindset—a culture of injury
              prevention in the workplace.</p>

          <h2>Pre-employment Testing</h2>
              <p>Not all job applicants are cut out to handle
                the physical requirements for certain positions, but how
                can you know for certain an applicant can perform before
                 being hired? The wrong people at certain tasks can mean
                  lost productivity and an increased chance of injury.
                  PRC can administer a quick, inexpensive and comprehensive
                   test designed to assess a prospective employee’s
                   ability to perform essential tasks. A pre-employment
                   test gives the confidence that your job candidate can
                   perform as required without opening your company to a
                   higher risk of injuries. PRC designs a test legally
                   defensible and unique to your company.</p>
          <h2>Injury Care</h2>
              <p id="occu-end">When patients do need treatment, PRC returns
                them to work as soon as possible while maintaining the
                highest levels of care and rehabilitation. The average
                patient in PRC’s care returns to full-duty work in less
                than five therapy sessions. You end up with more
                uctive employees while controlling your company’s costs.</p>
