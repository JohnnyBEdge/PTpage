          <h2>Physical Therapy</h2>
          <p>We are committed to the patient experience and increased the time
             that a physical therapist spends with each patient. PRC has
             always offered a clinical environment that is focused on
             medically based rehabilitation. We are neither a health club
             nor an alternative medicine provider. As healthcare dollars
             are stretched, many providers are using ancillary staff to
             fill the gaps. We still subscribe to the philosophy that
             one-on-one interaction with a PRC therapist is crucial to a
             patient’s rehab experience. We are passionate about
             understanding each patient’s unique anatomy and how he or she
             can reach their desired goals.</p>

          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>At Performance Rehab Clinic, our philosophy is that one-on-one
            interaction with a knowledgeable physical therapist is crucial
             to a patient’s rehab experience. We are passionate about
             understanding each patient’s unique circumstances and helping
             them achieve their goals. As we build plans around you and your
              abilities, we want to focus on your needs and goals.</p>

          <h2>Sports Medicine</h2>
          <p>We take pride in providing evidence-based approaches to treatment
             for an ever-widening list of diagnoses. We are experienced and
              knowledgeable in sports-related injuries. Performance Rehab
              Clinic treats athletes at every level and in every discipline;
              while we have experience treating elite-level athletes, many of
              our patients are amateur to intermediate athletes as well.</p>

          <h2>Orthopedic Rehab</h2>
          <p>Orthopedics is the field of medicine concerned with the
             musculoskeletal system. We are experienced in treating
              a broad range of diagnoses, including acute and chronic
              injuries along with surgical and non-surgical orthopedic
              cases.</p>
